## Projects

This repository showcases a collection of my academic projects and personal projects. 
The goal of these projects is to leverage on data to generate meaningful and impactful insights that can help support decision-making processes. 


# Academic Projects
J&T Demand Forecasting and Route Optimization: 
This project focuses on solving operational challenges faced by J&T Express, a leading logistics provider in Southeast Asia and China. The company has been experiencing delayed deliveries and parcel bottlenecks at hubs, largely due to inefficiencies in route planning and an inability to anticipate fluctuations in e-commerce demand. Thus, the aim of this project is to address these ineffiencies through demand forecasting and route optimization predictive analytics. 


# Personal Projects 
FMCG Sales Data Analysis: 
This project involved performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a synthetic FMCG sales dataset to uncover key trends, patterns, and performance drivers. The objective was to generate insights that could support Sales, Finance, and Operations teams in making data-driven business decisions. EDA was performed in Python (Pandas) to uncover actionable insights, leading to recommendations for increasing sales and improving operational efficiency in logistics. Additionally, a simple and concise interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to enable Sales, Finance, and Operations teams to easily monitor and track sales performance.
